# Hash Hash Hash
This lab compares different hash table implementations and analyzes their performance in terms of execution time and accuracy across single-threaded, single-mutex multi-threaded, and multiple-mutex multi-threaded approaches.

## Building
Run this command in the same directory where the Makefile is located to build:
```shell
make
```
## Running
1. Run the tester with a thread count and total inserts (example: 8 threads, 50000 inserts):
```shell
./hash-table-tester -t 8 -s 50000
```
2. Try additional experiments (change either threads or size or both):
```shell
./hash-table-tester -t 8 -s 40000
./hash-table-tester -t 4 -s 50000
```
3. Results (example outputs running on a 8-core CPU machine):
```shell
$./hash-table-tester -t 8 -s 50000

## First Implementation
In the `hash_table_v1_add_entry` function, I added a single pthread_mutex_t guarding the entire hash table; each add_entry call acquires the lock, performs the insertion in the target bucket, and releases the lock before returning.

I also added `pthread_mutex_t mutex` member to the hash table structure, initialized it in the create routine, and bracketed add_entry with pthread_mutex_lock/pthread_mutex_unlock to enforce mutual exclusion.

We can guarantee the correctness because the mutex makes sure only one thread can modify the table at a time.

### Performance
```shell
$./hash-table-tester -t 8 -s 50000
Hash table base: 236,728 usec
Hash table v1: 674,478 usec
```
Version 1 is about 3x slower than base. This happens because we have thread creation overhead but then all threads just wait at the same mutex anyway, so we don't get any parallelism.

## Second Implementation
In the `hash_table_v2_add_entry` function, I added a `pthread_mutex_t` to each bucket, replacing the table-wide lock. With per-bucket locking, operations on different buckets proceed in parallel, and threads contend only when they access the same bucket.

I added a `pthread_mutex_t entry_mutex` to each bucket and 64 bytes of padding after the mutex to prevent false sharing between buckets. This keeps updates to different buckets from slowing each other down. In `hash_table_v2_add_entry`, only the target bucket’s mutex is locked and no table wide lock is used.

This works because each bucket has its own lock. Operations on different buckets run at the same time; only operations targeting the same bucket wait for one another. 

### Performance
```shell
$./hash-table-tester -t 8 -s 50000
Hash table base: 236,728 usec
Hash table v2: 62,701 usec

$./hash-table-tester -t 4 -s 50000
Hash table base: 67,602 usec
Hash table v2: 16,443 usec
```

Version 2 is around 3-4x faster than base. Now threads can actually work in parallel since different buckets have different locks.

## Cleaning up
To clean up and remove the executables created, use this command:
```shell
make clean
```
